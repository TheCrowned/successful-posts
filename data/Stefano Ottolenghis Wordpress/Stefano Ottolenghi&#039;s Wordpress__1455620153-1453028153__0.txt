This algorithm is at the core of my WordPress plugin <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/smart-tag-insert/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smart Tag Insert</a>.

First of all, there is a difference between a simple pattern matching and computing text pattern relevance. The question we are trying to address here is the following: I have a string, and <strong>I would like to know how much that string is relevant for a specific text</strong>. For example, let's say we have "download music" as the string of which relevance we are interested into. How can we determine how much relevant it is for a specific article?
<h2>The simple approach</h2>
The easy thing one could try is run a pattern match of "download music" in the article text. That is okay, but suppose the article contained strings like "download the music", or "download some music", or "downloading music", or "download good quality music". It is clear that, to a human, all these strings are equivalent when trying to understand what the article is about: it is about downloading music, regardless of whether it is good, bad, a lot or little.

<strong>A simple pattern match would fall short</strong>, because it would exclude all those other strings and make it look like the content is not very much about downloading music, just because "download music" was never found exactly that way.

So the first point we need to acknowledge if we want to try to teach a machine to compute text pattern relevance, is that <strong>we need to find a way</strong>, at least a rough way, <strong>to teach it to grasp the meaning of the content</strong>.

<!--more-->

(One thing that should be clear from the beginning is that we are not going to teach a machine to <em>understand</em> what a text is about, but rather whether the subject of the text is the one we are suggesting (for example, from a list). We are not asking what a text is about, we are asking whether the given text is related to "download music", and how we can assign a number to that relevance.)
<h2>A more sophisticated approach</h2>
So we have a couple of things we need to think about:
<ol>
 	<li>how do we run a <em>gentle</em> pattern match, so that "downloading music" gets recognized as well? However, we still don't want the match to be completely ineffective. If a text starts with "download" and ends with "music", and has 3k words in between, that match should value pretty low (or nothing). So the next problem is:</li>
 	<li>how do we effectively quantify the value of a single match?</li>
</ol>
<h2>The gentle/flexible pattern match</h2>
Point one is rather technical. We can build a regex that does the text pattern match the way we want like this:
<pre class="lang:default decode:true ">^\bdownload(.*?)\bmusic^i</pre>
People better at dealing with regular expressions than I am may notice that this regex does what we wished, but has a <strong>limitation</strong>: it will match fine "download some music" and even "downloading some musicality" (whatever it means), but it will miss "redownload music" and "download discomusic". The choice here is due to the fact that prefixes change word meanings more often than post-fixes do (for example, imagine a text about the "new york run": allowing prefixes as well as post-fixes would make "new york forerunner" seem related to the text, while it is not).

Anyway, in a human language our regex reads: match strings that
<ul>
 	<li>start with<em> download</em>. No exceptions. Don't allow anything before (this assures us a real match is starting);</li>
 	<li>at some point (even 1k chars away) have <em>music</em>. Again, not <em>discomusic</em> or any other prefix to <em>music</em>;</li>
 	<li>end after <em>music</em>;</li>
 	<li>do the above case-insensitively.</li>
</ul>
Of course, one can have regex for complex strings, however complex they may be. For example, if one wishes to match "download good music fast", the regex would be
<pre class="lang:default decode:true">^\bdownload(.*?)\bgood(.*?)\bmusic(.*?)\bfast^i</pre>
A good idea would be to <strong>discard matches with full stops in them</strong>, and we will do that while processing the matches.
<h2>Determining a relevance score</h2>
Once we find a match, we need to assign a score to it. The idea is that if "download music" is found exactly, then it Is a perfect match, if "download good and nice music" is found, then yes it should be a match, but we do not want it to have the same score as a perfect match, and if "downloading an antivirus is important so that your computer can't be hurt by fake music" is found, then it should have a pretty low score.

The idea is to <strong>rely on the number of characters that are between each word of the string to match</strong>. This is a rough method, but it is fine enough to grant decent relevance scores. Mathematically speaking, we want the relevance of a match to be a (strictly) <strong>decreasing function of the number of characters</strong> that stand in between of the match words.

The formula we are going to use can be schematized like this:
<blockquote>relevance of a match = relevance of a perfect match - decrease of relevance due to in between chars</blockquote>
This expression still has two unknown values. We thus have two questions to address now:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>What should the relevance of a perfect match be?</strong> My answer comes from the following (arguable) assumption: <strong>perfectly finding 10 times the match in a 360 words text means 100% relevance</strong> of the given string. This is actually kind of reasonable: if you consider that an average sentence can be of 30 words, then to find a perfect match in each sentence would need 12 matches in the whole text. We could use 12 instead of 10, but 12 relates to an unlikely scenario, and would probably make posts reach lower scores than their real ones. So 10 is my choice.</li>
 	<li><strong>How much should relevance decrease, given the number of chars in between?</strong> This is 100% empirical, based on my expectations on test texts, but it looked like <em>x^(4/5)</em> is fine. It plays well on small numbers (so that "download the music" has still quite high a relevance) but gets bigger as soon as numbers grow a little bit, so that it drops the relevance of matches with words too far apart.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Share your knowledge!</h2>
Now, I am sure there are better ways to compute pattern relevance in a text. This article wants to be a starting point for methods of this kind, since I am quite confident that the ideas and the questions I have tried to address here do have some value. <strong>Getting to the root of the questions that we need to answer to solve a specific problem is more important than the answers one can provide</strong>, and are anyway fundamental in finding the right answers. So if you have any idea to improve this method, or have something completely different in mind, please do share it in the comments below, I would really like to know!
<h2>The complete algorithm for text pattern relevance</h2>
At this point, we have everything to build the algorithm that will calculate the relevance given a string (needle) and a text (haystack). What follows is written in PHP.
<pre class="lang:php decode:true " title="Smart Tag Insert algorithm">function get_tag_relevance( $needle, $haystack, &amp;$overall_relevance ) {
   if( strlen( $haystack ) == 0 ) { $overall_relevance = 0; return; } //empty text -&gt; 0 relevance for everything
 
    //Break the pattern in single words
   $exploded_needle = explode( " ", $needle );
   $explode_count = count( $exploded_needle );
  
   //Strip special chars from text and count text words
   $purged_haystack = preg_replace( '/[(),;:!?%#$"_+=\\/-]+/', '', trim( preg_replace( '/\'|&amp;nbsp;|&amp;#160;|\r|\n|\r\n|\s+/', ' ', strip_tags( $haystack ) ) ) ); //need to trim to remove final new lines
   $haystack_words = count( preg_split( '/\s+/', $purged_haystack, -1, PREG_SPLIT_NO_EMPTY ) );

   //Calculate how much a perfect occurrence should weigh
   $occurrence_weigth = 10*350/$haystack_words; //we consider perfectly finding 10 times the tag in a 360-words text as 100% relevance

   //Build the regex pattern
   $pattern = "^\b";
   $n = 1;
   foreach( $exploded_needle as $single ) {
      $pattern .= $single;

      if( $n &lt; $explode_count )
      $pattern .= "(.*?)\b";

      ++$n;
   }

   $pattern .= "^i"; //case insensitive

   $output = array();
   $overall_relevance = 0;
   preg_match_all( $pattern, $haystack, $occurrences, PREG_PATTERN_ORDER );

   //preg_match_all( $pattern, $haystack, $occurrences_offsets, PREG_OFFSET_CAPTURE ); //this can be useful in computing relevance, maybe early matches should weigh more than later ones

   if( count( $occurrences[0] ) == 0 ) return 0;

   //If the string to match is just one word, its relevance is its weigth * times it occurres
   if( $explode_count == 1 ) {
      $overall_relevance = count( $occurrences[0] )*$occurrence_weigth;

   } else {
      $n = 0;
      foreach( $occurrences[1] as $single ) {
         //If pattern words are separated by a full stop, this shouldn't count as a match
         if( strpos( $single, '.' ) !== false ) continue;

         //Calculate how much this occurrence contributes to overall relevance
         $single = trim( $single );
         $relevance = $occurrence_weigth - ( pow( strlen( $single ), 4/5 ) );
         $output[] = array(
            "text_in_between" =&gt; $single,
            "relevance" =&gt; $relevance/*,
            "offset" =&gt; $occurrences_offsets[0][$n][1]*/
         );

         $overall_relevance += $relevance;
         ++$n;
      }
   }

   if( $overall_relevance &gt; 100 )
   $overall_relevance = 100;

   return $output;

This is the review of the laptop released in December 2015. I purchased the version with <strong>Intel Core 6th gen i3 6100U, 8GB DDR3 and 256 GB SSD</strong>.

<blockquote><strong>NOTE to European people</strong>: I've just discovered the British <a href="http://pcspecialist.co.uk">PC Specialist</a> does a similar service with very little shipping costs to Europe. My girlfriend purchased basically the very same laptop I have, but costed $350 less in shipping!</blockquote>
<h2>THINGS I DON'T LIKE ABOUT SYSTEM76 LEMUR</h2>
<blockquote>August 2016 update: <strong>my screen turned to a shade of pink</strong>. All of a sudden, while working, colors flickered and it's just as if a pink filter is in front of it now. Some times it flickers back to white, but most of the time it's pinkish. Of course System76 offered to fix the issue for free, but it would have costed me at least $400 in shipping, so clearly this was not an option.</blockquote>
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://www.thecrowned.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Lemur_feature4.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49463"><img class="wp-image-49463 size-medium alignright" src="http://www.thecrowned.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Lemur_feature4-e1451740982457-300x175.png" alt="Lemur_feature4" width="300" height="175" /></a>The screen has a <strong>poor opening angle</strong> (I'd say around 120 degrees). This is not a problem if you put it on a desk with a proper chair, but as soon as you put it on your lap or if you are higher than your table, you'd immediately like the screen to open some more.</li>
 	<li>The SD card reader <strong>doesn't work with Sandisk Extreme</strong> 90MB/s or even 60 MB/s. System76 said these are extremely new and high speed cards, but this is not a justification to me as my 10-years-old card reader handles them just fine.</li>
 	<li><strong>Build quality is cheap</strong>. It's all bendy plastic. I've got light scratches everywhere, and some deep ones. Just laying copybooks on my laptop shouldn't make deep scratches.</li>
 	<li><strong>Screen brightness is too high</strong>, even at its minima. In normally (and even poor) lit environments this is fine, but when you are in the dark you have the feeling a lamp is being pointed at you.</li>
 	<li><strong>Volume is still a bit low</strong>, even at its maxima. This may be due to the fact that speakers are located under the laptop.</li>
</ul>
<h2>REASONS WHY I'D PURCHASE THE SYSTEM76 LEMUR AGAIN</h2>
<blockquote>I still stand behind everything I had written below, but given the screen fault and other shortcomings, and that PC Specialist is offering such a discounted service (at least to me, in Europe), I'd buy from them rather than from System76.</blockquote>
It's great. It just works. Beautifully. It's reliable, and quiet. And when I say quiet, I really mean that I've heard the fan start going a couple of times in 6 months.

I've been asked several times why I didn't purchase a <em>normal</em> laptop from a <em>normal</em> company. There are two reasons:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Normal companies don't make laptop for normal people</strong>.</li>
 	<li><strong>Normal laptop</strong> from normal companies <strong>are not built to last</strong>.</li>
</ol>
It's quite clear to me that the laptops you find in a shop are built so that 4 years later you will need to buy a new one. Just look at the average configuration of a decent laptop (which would be around $500): Intel i5 CPU, 4 GB RAM, 1 TB HDD, some dedicated graphics card. Now, how much of that my mother needs? Little nothing, and it's lacking what she'd really need.
<ol>
 	<li>Graphics card are completely useless to the average user. Highest graphical need is the Windows GUI, why waste $80+ on something needless?</li>
 	<li>Intel i5 CPU - right, okay, it's gonna be fast, but how much does it need to be fast a laptop to surf the internet and watch a film?</li>
 	<li>1 TB HDD? My whole film collection takes less than that. Like, really. Put in a SSD of 256 GB and stop this fuss of having bigger drives.</li>
 	<li>4 GB RAM is fine. But it's <em>just</em> fine. Ubuntu with Chrome (5 tabs) open takes 1,7 GB. My mother has Windows, an antivirus, dropbox, 15 tabs open, and generally forgets to close anything she opens. Now suppose she has 3 GB busy. Just let the next Windows come out and it won't fit on her machine, and voilà: you need a new laptop.</li>
 	<li>If you look for a higher-end laptop, they'll put in an Intel i7. What on earth is my mother supposed to do with a 4-core 3 GHz? It would just drain the battery in an hour! Oh yes, I forgot to say, My <strong>new Lemur's battery lasts five damn hours</strong>!</li>
</ol>
The wonderful thing with <strong>System76</strong> is that it <strong>gives you the choice</strong> of the PC you want to have: you start with a basic setup and you can tweak it to fit your needs. They're <strong>providing a service to users</strong>, not just requesting them money. Plus, it <strong>costs around the same</strong> amount as a normal computer from a normal company, so why not? (I spent a hell lot of money to get it to my house, but I'm not from the USA) Not to mention the <strong>quality support and availability of the System76 team</strong>, something which you wouldn't get from a normal company, not even in a million years.

System76 does good work for little the right money and probably reduces technology waste over time. I think it's <strong>our responsability as tech guys to feed this kind of companies</strong> instead of careless giants.

And yet, it looks to me that we give for granted the most basic assumption, which is that these things exist as we see them. I mean, we see a penguin and we think that yeah, that’s the classic example of the capital-P Penguin, of the “<em>penguiness</em>”. But where is this “penguiness” to be seen? Can we think of it? Can we say it is real?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><!--more--></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Wondering at what is real and what is not means digging really deep into philosophy, which would probably lead us nowhere, but if we stick to physics… what do we get? We do get something interesting indeed. Physics tells us that all things, ranging from stars to sn<img class="alignright wp-image-1210" src="http://www.thecrowned.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/10330341_10152163570733576_8255782982304475793_n.jpg" alt="IPSC 2014" width="344" height="344" />ails, are all made of the same stuff, which is atoms, little balls that we, as limited beings, are not allowed to see. These balls arrange one beside the other for tremendous lengths and give rise to our beloved penguins. Now, even though different atoms exist, they come in a finite number. What makes up all the infinity of beautiful things around us is the way atoms put together, the way they have metaphorical sex. Atoms are really nothing more than the alphabet of nature: with a set of finite items, countless combinations are possible. So the first lesson of our journey is that, sadly, penguins do not exist as penguins, but should be imagined as groups of atoms.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps, a more surprising fact is that atoms are mostly empty. What we call the nucleus in the atom, takes way less than 1% of it, all that is left is empty space, the space where electrons live. This means that what appears to us as rock solid, as completely full in some way, is actually almost completely empty. And this rises a number of super-intriguing questions among which: what does it mean to “<em>touch</em>”?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What touch is, has a very interesting explanation. We are used to seeing things touching each other, (which happens when the distance between two objects becomes null). But can something like this really happen? Actually, it can’t. It is not possible for two atoms to come in contact or be squeezed together. What happens is that electrons get very jealous of their homes around the nucleus: they have lived there all their lives and are not willing to give them up to foreigners. So when another atom comes near, electrons start fighting for their own space and prevent it from coming close. In this sense, electrons are very bad hosts. You can picture the clapping of your hands as a struggle between electrons, in which each of them fiercely defends its own space, and the more you push your hands together, the harder the combat gets.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These electron-fights are just one example of the bustle of nature, of the activity that goes on under the hood even though we cannot see it directly. What we can do, is imagine it. Think of a glass of water. It may appear like the most uninteresting, still and dull thing, so quiet it may not even be worth considering. But atoms are never still, they can never be. They are the guests of a never-ending worldwide party in which music never stops and they never get tired of dancing. They are always giggling and buzzing, and sometimes their dancing becomes so frenetic that they jump away from the dance floor and start floating in the air. This is what we call evaporating, and now <em>this</em> is a dull name for an exciting phenomenon.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Now, what’s the point? First, these things are fascinating to me. Every time I am feeling down or bored, I always wear my special imaginary glasses to look at reality the way I have described it, to remind myself how interesting and amazing our world is. But the point is that you can know all these facts, and yet look at the world as the darkest and dullest place ever. Most people who know these things do not look at the world as the largest dancing floor, in which a huge number of excited dancers move around making up the objects that we see, and that is because they are not using their imagination. Knowledge is helpful, indeed it is needed, for imagination to work. But facts alone are nothing, we need imagination to understand their meaning. The key to a happier, more interesting and fascinating world is imagination.</p>

I guess it is better to use your hands to dial a number or text someone instead of telling your glasses to do so without getting your hands off the wheel, but whatever. Anyway, they have not banned something that does <em>not</em> distract drivers, they have banned a product that could <strong>dramatically increase safety on the road</strong>. I can think of two ways it would, but I am sure there are plenty more. Here my two ideas for Google Glass while driving:
<!--more-->
<ol>
	<li><strong>Know how skilled the drivers around you are</strong>. Every driver would have a score based on their past actions. If they did not give way when they should have, their score would go down; if they passed with a red light, their score would go down... Every potentially harmful action they do is tracked down and recorded in some big database. While you are driving, Google Glass would then scan the license plates of the cars around and tell the driver how good the people around them are. Of course you cannot really rely on a good score to be sure some driver will not commit any mistakes, but at least you will keep away from the acknowledged bad ones, which would immediately result in fewer accidents. 

Of course there a lot of details left out here, such as the difference between a car and the driver: a car can be driven by different people and it would not be fair to penalize someone because of someone else's actions, so a way to distinguish between drivers would be needed. Moreover, we need to punish those who do not stick to the highway code, but with time they should also be able to get a higher ranking if they do not make any more mistakes. I am sure the UK government would come up with a solution for both issues, if it used its time usefully instead of banning something they do not know. If the did not ban, like, <em>progress</em>.</li>

	<li><strong>Know what awaits you behind a turn</strong>. This would need some work by the governments, but it would be something very appreciated by drivers, I am sure, especially by moto riders. Cameras, instead of mirrors, would be placed at turns, and Google Glass would show in your eye what the nearest camera can see, so that drivers would know what there is beside a turn. It would be impossible to have an accident just because there is a queue behind the turn, because you would know it beforehand. 

Now, I get this takes money and work, <em>I am just imagining</em>. That is what you are supposed to do: you get a new technology, and you wonder: "<em>What awesome stuff could we do with this new thing?</em>" and you start thinking even about things which are not likely to be done because are expensive and time-consuming, but how else do you thing progress will come? Surely not by banning a new technology because you are afraid people may use it to browse their socials...</li>

My family phoned me or just met me. Then there has been a handful of people who texted me on my mobile, mostly in the morning. I do not care how they remembered my birthday's date, what I care about is that they took the time and the money (for those who paid) to text me. I am not ashamed to admit I use myself both Facebook and my mobile phone agenda to keep track of birthdays, apart from certain ones that are quite stuck in my head. But what I liked is that those people, the ones who texted me, tried to think of something nice to write and they actually came up with something sweet, something you would fancy reading after waking up. Those were the people closer to me. Some of them even told me that it was Facebook that remembered them it was my birthday, but they actually sent me an SMS and did not use Facebook to write me.

Next there was the Facebook world. Usually, who is friends with me on Facebook also has my phone number, so they could have easily sent me a message with their greetings, or wrote me an email as some did indeed. A lot of people, instead, wrote on my Facebook wall for my birthday. There were schoolmates of 5 years or so ago, people from my middle school and even guys who are still with me at school and that, although they met me in the morning at school (either in class or through the corridors), wrote on Facebook instead of just telling me "Happy birthday" face to face. Strangely enough, the people who wished me a happy birthday by voice wrote it on Facebook too. There were even people I never met with whom I am only friend in a virtual manner, the people I usually see once a year at the seaside and do not really spend time with, people I knew in afternoon classes years ago with whom I did not actually have any real relationship.

You know, I do not really question their wishes, there is nothing bad in wishes as long as they are true and sincere. There were some people from whom I was glad to receive wishes, people whose messages contained my name and even some sort of joke that could kind of show we were friends, that we shared something. But that was a minority, the vast majority simply wrote "Happy birthday". Nothing more. Something a stranger could have easily said. And that is the point: if we are not much more that strangers I do not expect you to wish me happy birthday, it is something you are not supposed to do and for which I will not blame you.

I have already talked about how <a href="http://www.thecrowned.org/how-facebook-is-killing-real-relationships" target="_blank">Facebook is killing real relationiships</a>, and if you wanted a proof here it is. It is ok if you use Facebook just to keep track of your friends' birthdays, what is not fine is to use it to wish them happy birthday when you could use other, more intimate means like walking to him, texting him or writing some kind of email or private chat.

Today I think that's true more than ever, and I will tell you why.

My opinion is that Facebook is <strong>something to pop up at 9 in the evening</strong>, when after a 14 hours day you are too tired to do anything else. You open it and just start <strong>lurking around</strong> new friends embarassing photos (like grils' bikini ones), laughing at childish status updates and links and browsing your groups recent activities. At least, that is how I use that damn website, <strong>pub<img class="size-full wp-image-174 alignright" title="modern_media_illustration" src="http://www.thecrowned.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/modern_media_illustration.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="350" />lishing hironyc and nonsense content without really telling people nothing serious about myself</strong>. Quotes are the farthest thing I do. Instead, <strong>people use to put there all their lives</strong> - their interests, hobbys, wants, likes and dislikes and, most important, friends interactions. We've all seen that "John is engaged with Melissa" with around 15 likes under it and as many comments saying "man enjoy it" or "sis I'm so happy about that!". Few people actually realize <strong>they are losing the real social interaction that piece of news may have generated</strong>. Remember the old style way - just to wait to really meet the people you care about and tell them orally or, better, organize an appointment?

<!--more-->

A lot of people <strong>just use Facebook as a replacement for real life while</strong>, at the very same time, <strong>considering it a different reality</strong>. I know it sounds weird, but that is really how it appears to me. It is definitely kind of odd considering a different reality something they spend 1-2 hours a day on, yet being the place where they get in touch with their friends. My fellows do not seem to understand that every tiny piece of information, the tiniest indeed, they put on Facebook (being it a status update, link, photo or whatever) is somehting that mirrors their personality. Therefore, it may mean <strong>there may be people who can form an idea on how a person is just looking at their Facebook profile</strong>. Sadly, it is this way. And it is shuddering. If you listen to certain music you are more likely to be a certain type of person, and it is the same for the poses you take in photos, the kind of links you share, whether you share your sentimental status or not, how often you engage and break up... <strong>Literally everything on Facebook mirrors the writer</strong>. Not good. It is dangerous not to acknowledge and remember this. Unfortunately, I come to be into that really small group of few people who can join all these information together. That is the reason why <strong>I stopped asking and accepting Facebook friendships from people I do not know well enough and who I plan to know thoroughly in person</strong>. This is because <strong>saying yes to a Facebook friendship request is saying no to a real relationship</strong>.

Guys, the pleasure of friendship is <strong>to know the people you spend time with, not having virtual interactions with them</strong>. Think about this: it is much more likely you will have a deep conversation with someone on a Facebook chat than in person. This has always happened and probably will happen forever. Wanna advice? Avoid that. Even though Facebook make people show involuntarily their characters, it also reveals the essence of them. <strong>People chatting with you will be themselves in such a way that they won't</strong>. When you have the possibility to write instead of speak, you have all the time you may need to think about what to say, and you rarely end up saying the same things as speaking. <strong>Does that reveal the essence of a person? Yes. Is that the person you would know in public? No</strong>. So <strong>you start knowing a person that virtually does not exist</strong>. You may get a crush for that nonexistent person (and tell them your love in a chat) or even hate that person. I am afraid of saying that in the web half measures rarely exist. Also remember that writing hides facial expressions and gestures, so that half of the communication is lost. If you are smart enough to look at your speaker's eyes when in person, you can not deny that the look is part of the conversation.

<strong>Having too much information</strong> in bulk about a person through its Facebook profile <strong>may actually make people go away</strong>. Have you ever thought that? Let's put this to real life, shall we? Say you are a boy who likes rock music, wears Converse All Star, watches horror films and reads historical books. You have met a girl, a pretty one, who, after a first talk, you regard as interesting. You wanna now her better. What would you do - What is the dreadfully wrong thing you would do? Open Facebook, of course. And there, in her profile, you learn she likes pop music, wears boots, watch love films and reads thrillers. <strong>Would you still think she is worth knowing?</strong> I guess no. And yet, that could be the girl of your life! Maybe, knowing her piece by piece, as time passed by, you may have loved her.

This year, in high school, my class was joined with another one of the same year just because we were two courses of about 14 people, too few... Now that we are together,<strong>we just can not get in touch</strong>. Since the first day there is one class sitting on the left part of the room, and the other one staying on the right. We seldom interact (though with some exceptions) and even when doing PE we do not really know how to cope with each other. The first day I thought we would get on well, it was just a matter of time before we knew and liked. But now, for how things are turning out, I am not that sure about it anymore. After about a month of school I noticed all the guys in my class are friends on Facebook, even between the once two different courses. But hey, that is weird, <strong>they have never spoken with each other</strong>, nor that I know at least! They surely have not gone beyond the polite "hello" or "what's for tomorrow?". But <strong>yet they are friends online</strong>. I can not get it, maybe I am missing something, but I really can not get it. I mean, what is the purpose of this all? <strong>I fear those people will never know really</strong>.

Facebook is a very large and interesting topic, and I will probably write about it again. It is a fantastic platform when it is up to communication, but nothing more. Communicating is what Facebook is good for. <strong>Forgetting this means leaving real life behind and giving Facebook a primary role</strong> even though it should not be this way. Some people prefer to declare themselves (as I did until an year ago) against Facebook, saying they will never sign-up. I think this is as bad as using it all day because it kind of cuts you out.<strong>There is nothing terrible on being on Facebook, there are only a few things to remember.</strong>";s:10:"post_title";s:42:"How Facebook is killing real relationships";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:42:"how-facebook-is-killing-real-relationships";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-08-26 08:50:26";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-08-26 07:50:26";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";i:0;s:4:"guid";s:32:"http://www.thecrowned.org/?p=162";s:10:"menu_order";i:0;s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"4";s:6:"filter";s:3:"raw";s:10:"sp_metrics";a:2:{i:0;i:17;i:1;d:0;}s:9:"post_tags";a:2:{i:0;s:8:"facebook";i:1;s:15:"social networks";}s:15:"post_categories";a:1:{i:0;s:15:"social networks";}}i:8;O:7:"WP_Post":27:{s:2:"ID";i:100;s:11:"post_author";s:1:"1";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2011-09-03 14:53:28";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2011-09-03 12:53:28";s:12:"post_content";s:2929:"Hi everybody, <em>[everybody stand up]</em> I'm Stefano from Genoa, Italy.
