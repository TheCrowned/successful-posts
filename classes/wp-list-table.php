 * exactly the way we need it to be.
 *
 * To display this example on a page, you will first need to instantiate the class,
 * then call $yourInstance->prepare_items() to handle any data manipulation, then
 * finally call $yourInstance->display() to render the table to the page.

     * specifically build for a given column. Generally, it's recommended to include

     * neat and organized. For example, if the class needs to process a column
     * named 'title', it would first see if a method named $this->column_title()

     * be used. Generally, you should try to use custom column methods as much as
     * possible.

     * Since we have defined a column_title() method later on, this method doesn't
     * need to concern itself with any column with a name of 'title'. Instead, it
     * needs to handle everything else.
